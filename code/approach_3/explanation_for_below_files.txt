Here I tried to fine-tune the Tesseract OCR model. But couldn't complete fine tuning process.

Below are some of file scripts and codes that are used in fine tuning process.

-- generate_box_files.bat file - To generate .box type files for each input image

-- generate_train_files.bat file - To generate .tr files for each input image (This is where I got terminated)

-- generate_txt_files_for_input_images.py file - To generate .txt files for each image
